WebRTC-iOS
==========

WebRTC iOS example app.

Thanks for this article: http://ninjanetic.com/how-to-get-started-with-webrtc-and-ios-without-wasting-10-hours-of-your-life/

Forked from http://webrtc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk. Updated to the latest webrtc iOS example code from google. Not sure the trunk directory is needed.

To Run example:

Build this code for a device (iPad or iPhone).
Open a Google Chrome browser (not IE, Firefox or Safari - spent a day debugging why Firefox was not working - CHROME!!)
Open this URL: https://apprtc.appspot.com
Ensure the camera on your laptop has an image
Make note of the room number in the URL after loading web page
Run the iOS app and type in the room number
Sit back .... Should here feedback audio between your laptop and iOS device.
